# Species-Richness-over-time

## Description
- The core objective of this application is to visualize the correlation between species richness (S) and time (years), enabling users to understand changes in biodiversity over a specified period. A slider tool allows for customization of the time range displayed on the graph. Additionally, users can filter the data by selecting specific taxa and climate types to refine the displayed results.
- Modifying the year filter, climate filter, or taxa selection would cause a corresponding change in the graph, while the map would remain unaffected by the year filter since it solely indicates the geographic distribution of taxa based on the selected climate.

## Running the app
- For the application to be executed, it is imperative that specific data files are present at designated locations. These files have been provided as attachments and should be downloaded and stored in a folder named 'data' prior to running the application.
- If the code still does not execute, it is necessary to specify the file paths within the application code if the pre-existing paths are not compatible with the system configuration.
- The system allows for customization of filters, enabling the user to selectively view data pertaining to specific taxa based on their preferences.
