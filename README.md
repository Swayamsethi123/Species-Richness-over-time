# Species-Richness-over-time

## Description
- This application depicts the relationship of species richness(S) with time(years). This basically tells the biodiversity change over a period of time. The range of the time can be selected using the slider. To view only data of particular taxa you can choose them and the type of climate can also be chosen.
- Change in the year filter, climate filter or selecting the taxa would lead to change in the graph. The map does not get affected due to the year as it is just to indicate the geographical locations of taxa according to the specified climate.

## Running the app
